#A bilit-in data type that lets us crate immutable sequences of values

# How to define Tuple
"""
Diff between List and Tuple

List: all values are Homogeneous i.e. similar meaning
Lists are Mutable
Example: expense list exp = [12, 456, 654]

Tuple: all value are Hetrogeneous i.e. different meaning
Tuples are Immutable
Example: list of x & y coordinates point = (8,9)

#tup.index(el)  returns index of first occurrence

#tup.count(el)  counts total occurrences
